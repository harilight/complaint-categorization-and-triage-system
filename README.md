# Complaint Categorization and Triage System

An NLP-based system that categorizes raw e-commerce customer complaints into issue types and performs rule-based triage to assign business priorities for faster and more effective customer support.

## Overview
This project aims to automate the initial handling of customer complaints by combining text classification with business-rule-based prioritization. The system helps reduce manual effort and improves response time in large-scale customer support operations.

## Dataset
The project uses an original complaints dataset (`complaints.csv`) included in this repository.

- The dataset is provided in its original, unmodified form.
- It contains raw textual complaints along with relevant metadata for categorization.
- Any preprocessing or transformations applied are documented in the code.

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Complaint categorization using NLP techniques
- Rule-based triage to assign priority levels based on complaint type and severity

## Use Case
This system can be applied in:
- E-commerce customer support platforms
- Service desk automation
- Complaint management and prioritization systems
